This app is based on code produced by the 2013 Canals team.

Example data is included in the "counts.csv" file.
All fields should be included, though the latitude and longitude aren't strictly needed.

To add data to the tool, only the csv must be updated.
If other types of locations need to be added, the shapefiles must be combined and uploaded to the console.
When merging data on the console, the final grou should be titled "Merged Bridge APP Data".

Tourism and resident numbers are hard-coded into the file.
All the yearly numbers were sourced from Migropolis.
Monthly tourim numbers are from the COSES report.
